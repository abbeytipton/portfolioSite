              Users can also change their default filters on the Scrum Board; if they'd like to default to see only
              their issues, only issues for a certain project, only certain issues types, or a combination, they can use
              the dropdown boxes here to do so.<br><br>
              Finally, users can update their alert settings. They can choose when they'd like to receive email alerts
              and alerts on the site.

                    be connected by userID to the User table. Each user can add recipients that they plan to give gifts to. Finally,
                    the Gifts table will hold gifts the user has given; this table will connect via userID to the Users table and via
                    recipientID to the Recipients table.
